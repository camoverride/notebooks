# Notebooks

Notebooks, data, and models for various projects I've worked on.

Some datasets and models are too large for Github to handle and live on my personal server instead. If you encounter any missing data, that's what's happened!

- `data` contains some datasets I play with.
- `models` contains model artifacts I've created.
- `notebooks` is where the action is.


## Notebooks

### ANN's

A learning notebook where I introduce Artificial Neural Networks.


### Document Classification

Experiments with a few different document classification strategies.


### Emotion Detection Transfer Learning v1

I use VGG16 for the lower layers of my model and add a few additional layers to perform emotion classification. Accuracy is only around 45% across 7 classes (random would be 14%).


### Emotion Detection Transfer Learning v2

I implement [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1710.07557.pdf) which uses the same dataset as **Emotion Detection v1** and creates an XCEPTION model. Accuracy is 65%.


### Everything About Linear Regression

I teach you literally everything about linear regression.


### Filters in Keras

Experimenting with filters in Keras.


### MNIST Transfer Learning

I create a CNN that classifies clothing. I then apply this model to clothing I found on Google images.


### Regularization

I show you how to regularize overfit models.

### Sound Similarity

I use math to measure how similar different languages sound to each other - the results are surprising.
